<p style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;">This visualization is about the
    <strong>Tour de France</strong>, an annual multiple-stage road bicycle race primarily held in France. It is one of
    the three grand tours in the yearly cycling calendar, and currently consists of 21 stages over the course of 23
    days. It is considered to be the most important bike race in the year, in terms of both prestige and public
    awareness. Winning just a single stage is considered to be a bigger achievement than winning some of the biggest one
    day races! This importance as a sporting event, alongside its rich history (the first edition was held in 1903) make
    it a major event in a lot of peoples year. Due to the unavoidable changes in rules since then, this page focuses on
    how the race functionned in the last few decades.

<div class="inf_tab_col_content">
    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">Until 1930, riders were racing individually and there where no teams. Nowadays, cycling
        is, even if it is not obviously apparent to unfamiliar spectators, a team sport. In the Tour de France, there
        are usually between 20 and 22 teams participating. All of the <strong>World Tour</strong> teams (the highest
        level of cycling competition) are always participating. The best performing team of the <strong>Pro
            Series</strong> (the second division) is also automaticaly invited. The other teams are selected by the race
        organisers and are usually french teams competing in the Pro Series. Each team fields the same number of riders,
        that is 9 for the last few years. Overall, every year there are always around 200 riders taking part in the
        race.

<button type="button" class="inf_tab_collapsible">🏆 How is the winner decided?</button>
<div class="inf_tab_col_content">
    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">At the end of each stage, the winner of that stage is honoured on the days podium. The
        ranking of each stage is based on the time each rider took to finish, that is the winner is the first across the
        line. Each stage has a time limit (x minutes after the winner crosses the line) and riders finishing outside it
        are eliminated.</p>
    <p>More importantly, there is the main ranking that defines the overall races winner. This is called the
        <strong>General Classification</strong> or <strong>GC</strong> for short. To compute this ranking, the time
        taken by each rider on each stage is added up and the one with the smallest time after the last stage is the
        winner. Finishing inside the top 10 of the GC is a career highlight for a lot of riders. There are also 4 other
        competitions over the course of the entire race. Some of them have a defining jersey that is worn by the leader
        of that classification at every stage.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>General Classification</h5>
            <p><img style="height: 3em; width: auto; padding-right: 9px;" src="../resources/yellow_jersey.svg"
                    align="left" /> The leader wears the yellow jersey. As mentionned above, the time taken to complete
                all stages decides the winner.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Mountains Classification</h5>
            <p><img style="height: 3em; width: auto; padding-right: 9px;" src="../resources/kom_jersey.svg"
                    align="left" /> The leader wears the King of the Mountain (KOM) jersey. Riders arriving first atop
                classified (notable) climbs gain points. The number of points and the number of riders receiving those
                points depend on the classification of the climb. They are, in order of least to most important: fourth
                category, third category, second category, first category, hors catégory. The rider with the most points
                after all stages wins.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Points Classification</h5>
            <p><img style="height: 3em; width: auto; padding-right: 9px;" src="../resources/green_jersey.svg"
                    align="left" /> The leader wears the green jersey. Points are awarded to riders at intermediate
                sprints (virtual finish lines before the actual end of the stage) and at the end of stages expected to
                finish in a bunch sprint. The rider with the most points after all stages is the winner.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Young Rider Classification</h5>
            <p><img style="height: 3em; width: auto; padding-right: 9px;" src="../resources/white_jersey.svg"
                    align="left" /> The leader wears the white jersey. The winner is decided in the same way as for the
                General Classification, but only riders under the age of 26 are taken into account.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Combativity award</h5>
            <p>After the last stage, a jury designates the most combative rider of that edition. That same jury also
                designates the most combative rider of each stage. Whilst that rider does not get a distinctive jersey,
                he will wear a red number plate for the next stage.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Team classification</h5>
            <p> This prize is not considered to be very important and the teams never plan their strategy around winning
                it. The computation changes frequently but always considers the entire teams performance in the General
                Classification. At each stage, the currently leading teams members wear yellow number plates and
                sometimes yellow helmets.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

<button type="button" class="inf_tab_collapsible">🤔 What are stages?</button>
<div class="inf_tab_col_content">
    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">A <strong>stage</strong> can be considered in isolation as a one day bike race where
        the winner is the rider crossing the line first. There are two main categories of stages with different sets of
        rules.</p>

    <h5>Time trial</h5>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>🚴‍♀️ Individual time trial</strong>: riders complete a course alone and starting at a fixed time
            interval between them (e.g. 1 minute). The winner is the rider that took the least amount of time to
            complete the stage.</li>
        <li><strong>🚴‍♀️🚴‍♀️🚴‍♀️ Team time trial</strong>: work just like individual time trials but each team starts
            and rides together. The final time is the same for every rider on the same team and is taken once the last
            rider of that team crosses the line.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Mass start</h5>

    <p>During these stages the entire peloton starts at the same time. The winner is the rider that crosses the finish
        line first. The type of stage has a big influence on how it is raced, both in terms of team strategy and which
        type of rider has a chance at winning.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>🌳 Flat stage</strong>: these stages are usually long (&#62 200km) with no steep climbs and &#60
            800m of climbing over the entire stage. They usually finish with a bunch sprint.</li>
        <li><strong>🌄 Hilly stage</strong>: they are not as long (&#62 170km), with more climbing (&#60 1500m) and over
            steeper climbs. They can finish with a bunch sprint, but often the pure sprinters do not make it to the
            finish line with the main group and cannot contest them. <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su0KtKDQyqE">Breakaways</a> might also have a chance.</li>
        <li><strong>⛰️ Mountain stage</strong>: now there is even more climbing (&#62 2000m over the stage) with longer
            and steeper climbs. These stages often finish with a smaller group (&#60 20) of riders competing for the
            win. The breakaway might also have a chance and the GC contenders usually try to attack each other to gain
            time on their rivals.</li>
        <li><strong>🏔️ High mountain stage</strong>: a <em>lot</em> of climbing is involved, at least 3000m, and high
            altitudes of more than 2000m are reached. A reduced group, or even individual riders, will contest the win
            at the end of it. The GC battle is fierce on these stages.</li>
    </ul>
