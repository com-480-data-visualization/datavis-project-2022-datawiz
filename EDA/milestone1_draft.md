## Exploratory Data Analysis
The code for this EDA can be found in this notebook

For this project, we have the data of 106 Tours de France, from 1903 to 2019. Each one of these races is divided into stages. During the first ten edition, there were an average of 12.3 stages of 342.31km, and during the last ten edition there were always 21 stages with a mean of 167.05km. This trend of evolving towards more stages of shorter distances can be seen on Figure 1.



There is a total of 5126 unique riders who took part in at least one stage. Amongst them, Zoetemelk Joop has taken part in the most stages, with 387 stages. However, many riders have taken part in a similar number of stages, as this can be observed on Figure 2, where these top 30 riders have taken part in 301 stages on average.

These stages departed from 756 unique locations, situated mostly in France, but also from neighbouring countries. The top 5 countries where a stage departed can be seen on Figure 3.

13 different nations won a Tour de France, of which France, with its 36 victories, is by far the most dominating as it can be observed on Figure 4.
