# Milestone 1

## Dataset

This visualization will be about the Tour de France, a bike race held once every year. It is structured as a stage race with 21 day-long stages over the course of 23 days. Each of these stages has it's own classification, as if they were individual races. The time taken by each rider for each of these stages is also added up to form the general classification. This decides the race's overall winner. There are also other awards and general classifications, which are detailed on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_de_France#Classifications).

Our data comes from two datasets. [LeTourDataSet](https://github.com/camminady/LeTourDataSet) and [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-04-07/readme.md), which takes it's data in part from [Alastair Rushworth's github](https://github.com/alastairrushworth/tdf). They contain complementary information and can easily be joined to create the data we will use for our project.

We have complete data for the editions from 1903 to 2017, but only partial data for the races held from 2018 to 2021. The missing data could be completed without too much effort by using websites such as [procyclingstats](https://www.procyclingstats.com/) or [the official Tour de France website](https://www.letour.fr/en/history).

The data we will use is quite extensive. It contains, in summary, information about the winners of each year (as well as various information on them), the general classification, the results of each stage as well as what those stages where. Despite this extensiveness, we are missing the winners of the different general classifications other than the main one.

Overall, our data is clean and does not require extensive pre-processing. The missing data for the last few years is an issue though, but one which can be resolved by either completing it or simply focusing on the years where our data is complete.
